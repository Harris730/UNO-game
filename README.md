# UNO-game

## Overview
Uno is a card game in which players attempt to remove all cards from their hands by discarding them. Each player starts the round with 7 random cards in their hand.  During a player's turn, he/she attempts to discard a card by matching it to the last-discarded card, either by playing a card with the same color, the same face value, or by playing a wild card.
